Chicken and egg - slots need the component to yield 'slot' in order to register, but the component won't yield unless a slot has been registered

{{#sample-component as |slot|}}
  {{#block-slot slot "header" as |info w1 w2|}}
    I am the content {{info.title}} | {{w1}} {{w2}}
  {{/block-slot}}
  {{#block-slot slot "main" as |info w1 w2|}}
    I am the content {{info.title}} | {{w1}} {{w2}}
  {{/block-slot}}
  {{#block-slot slot "footer" as |info w1 w2|}}
    I am the content {{info.title}} | {{w1}} {{w2}}
  {{/block-slot}}
{{/sample-component}}
